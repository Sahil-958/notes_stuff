My notes are just a xerox copy of the books that are mentioned in my uni syllabus; i make notes only to organize books content to my likings (e.g. moving figures where they makes most sense)and to have them accessible on any system. I don't know if my notes will provide any value to you but if you thinking of using them please read the book first as the markdown there the headings, lists are there to organize them in markmap and doesn't represent how actually the content is laid out.
